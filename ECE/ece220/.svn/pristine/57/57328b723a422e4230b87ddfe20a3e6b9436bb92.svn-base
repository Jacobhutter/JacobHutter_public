Given an input at x4000, print out the binary representation to the console.

Example:
Input: x4000 - x1234
Console: 0001001000110100

This lab assignment is intended to provided a brief refresher on LC3 assembly.
You must write your code in the 'print_binary.asm' file (located in the 'src'
directory) where indicated to solve the above problem. The code contains all 
necessary data required to solve the problem (ASCII representations of 0 and 1). 
Note that there are a few ways to solve this problem and that to print a 
character to the console, you should make use of the OUT instruction.

A makefile has been provided to you to assemble inputs and print_binary files,
run tests, and clean .obj/.sym files. If you open the makefile, you will see a 
few labels followed by some commands. Typing in 'make' will execute commands 
associated with the 'all' label which references the 'sources' and 'input'
labels. After assemblying the program, all .obj/.sym files will be located
in the 'obj' directory. In case you would like to remove all .obj/.sym files, 
you can simply run 'make clean' (This may be more useful in the future for C 
labs/MPs in some situtations). 

All input and test files are located in the 'tests' directory. Running 'make 
test' will execute the 'runtests.sh' script in the 'tests' directory. To test 
the program, you can either do 'lc3sim -s tests/testX' for individual tests 
or './tests/runtests.sh' to run all tests.
