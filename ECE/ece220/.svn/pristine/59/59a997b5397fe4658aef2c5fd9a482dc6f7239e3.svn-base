Complete the 'find_duplicate' and 'find_unique' functions. For both of these
functions, you can assume that the input will only consist of characters from
'a-z'.

find_duplicate:
Given a string s, find the duplicate character in s. If there are no duplicates,
simply return 0. You can also assume that there will only be one duplicated 
character so s = "abcba" is an invalid input.

Example:
Input: s - abca
Output: a

find_unique:
Given a string s, find the unique character (the character that only occurs once
in the string). If there are no unique characters. simply return 0. You can 
assume that there will at most only be two of each characters so s = "ababa" is 
an invalid input.

Example:
Input: s - abcba
Output: c

To run a single test from the inside the 'lab' directory, do
'./bin/dup_unique x tests/<test>' where x is either a 0 (find_duplicate) or a 1
(find_unique) to test the appropriate function.
