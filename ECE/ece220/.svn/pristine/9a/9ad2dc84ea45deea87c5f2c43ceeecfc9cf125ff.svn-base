Complete the following functions in simp_tree.c:
get_size_st
print_pre_st
print_in_st
print_post_st
print_bfs_st
print_dfs_st
print_level_st
print_zigzag_st
All these functions return a 'Handle' type which is just an just an enum
defined in 'error.h'. You can just return 'E_SUCCESS' for all of these.

To solve some of these problems, you will need to make use of stacks and 
queues whose implementation has been provided to you in the 'src' directory.

Example:
Input: 5 3 4 1 6
Diagram:
    5
   / \
  3   6
 / \
1   4

Output:
get_size_st:     5
print_pre_st:    5 3 1 4 6
print_in_st:     1 3 4 5 6
print_post_st:   1 4 3 6 5
print_bfs_st:    5 3 6 1 4
print_dfs_st:    5 3 1 4 6
print_level_st:  3 6
print_zigzag_st: 5 6 3 1 4

get_size_st:
Print the size of the tree.

print_pre_st:
Prints a pre-order traversal of the tree.

print_in_st:
Prints an in-order traversal of the tree.

print_post_st:
Prints a post-order traversal of the tree.

print_bfs_st:
Prints a breadth first search traversal of the tree.

print_dfs_st:
Prints a depth first search traversal of the tree.

print_level_st:
Prints the kth level of the tree.

print_zigzag_st:
Alternates between printing the levels of the tree from the right and left 
sides. Starts rightward initially.

Assumptions:
--The tree will have at least one element in it.
