Instructions
************
Complete the 'find_permutation' function in permutation.c. Given two strings p 
and w, this function finds all permutations of p in w.

Example:
Input: p - dog, w - ddogg
Output: dog

Input: p - dog, w - gdogdo
Output: gdo dog ogd gdo

You will need to print out all the permutatios of p in w as shown in the 
examples above. As shown in the second example, permutations may overlap with 
each other.

Before writing the code for this lab, you should think about various strategies
that could be used to solve this problem. The optimized solution for this lab
should take no more than 20 actual lines of code (Ignoring {}, newlines, and
comments). Mine only took 10. :P

HINT:
Homomorphism

Assumptions:
--w will be at least as long p.

--Both the search and perm strings will only contain [a-z]+.
