************
Given two numbers at x5000 and x5001, find the greatest common denominator of
the two numbers and store the result in x5002:
Input: x5000 = x0004 and x5001 = x000C
Output: x5002 = 4

This lab assignment is intended to introduce functions and recursion in 
assembly programming. You must write your code in the 'gcd_recursion.asm' file
where indicated (MAIN, GCD, and MOD functions). To solve the problem please
refer to the algorithm below:

gcd(input u, input v)
  if v != 0
    gcd(v, mod(u, v))
  else
    return u

mod(input a, input b)
  return a%b (equivalent to remainder of a/b)

The provided code included the stack code used in MP2 if you wish to utilize it
in the assignment.

Similar to last lab, a makefile has been provided to you for assembling inputs
and testing your code against a few test cases.
