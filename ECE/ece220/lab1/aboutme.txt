Hello, my name is Jacob Hutter. I am currently a sophomore studying electrical engineering here at U of I. I have taken ECE 110, 120 and am currently enrolled in 210 and 220. I am interested in this department because of the high applicability of the material to the new and changing world. I am interested in changing my major to computer engineering because I enjoy the coding and computer architecture, especially in ece 120.
