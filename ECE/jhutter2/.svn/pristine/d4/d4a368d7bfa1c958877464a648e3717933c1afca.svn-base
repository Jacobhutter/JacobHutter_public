Complete the 'verify' function in verify.c. The goal of this lab will be to
verify input data in the provided test using regex. 

Input: <file>
Firstname Lastname
mm-dd-yyy
(nnn)-nnn-nnnn

The input file contain 3 lines of data in the order shown above You can make
the following assumption about each the of lines:
Firstname Lastname:
First/last names will start with a capital letter followed by all lowercase
letters. There is a single space between the two names.
mm-dd-yy:
This is a date with mm between 1 - 12, dd between 1 - 31 (I realize this allows
some extra days in certain months but oh well), and yyyy between 0000-9999.
(nnn)-nnn-nnnn:
This a telephone number with any of the digits, n, between 0 - 9.

This lab goes a bit ahead of the lecture since it requires to do some file I/O
to read the data from the provided file. I have left two variables that may be
useful to you: buffer and reg_flags. To read the file, I recommend you use the
function 'fgets' and store the data into buffer. As for the regex portion,
please take a look at http://www.peope.net/old/regex.html to see all the regex
related functions and a small example. When creating the regex, please pass the
provided reg_flags since it will make writing the regex easier (regex supports
BRE (Basic Regular Expression) and ERE (Extended Regular Expression) with the
latter being closer to what was shown in lab). 

A few things to note when working on this lab:
--fgets will read the '\n' character into the buffer; you should replace it
with a '\0' character.

--No support for '\d' so you will need to write it out manually.

--If you want to escape a character like '[', you will need to write '\\['.
