Instructions
************
This lab will a bit different from previous labs in that you will need to 
implement the Stack class by writing the stack.cpp file.

Functions to implement (all declared in stack.h):
bool is_empty()
std::size_t get_size() const
int peek() const
int push(int data)

The Stack class inherits from the List class whose functions I recommend you use
to implement the above functions. The code should be rather short and is meant
to serve as a demonstration of the various features of C++ not available in C.
