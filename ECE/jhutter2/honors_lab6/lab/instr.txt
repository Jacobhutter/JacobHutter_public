Complete the 'count_steps' function in count_steps.c. The problems can be
described as follows - "A child is running up a staircase with n steps and can 
hop either 1 step, 2 steps, 3 steps at a time. Count the total number of ways
that the child can run up the stairs."

Example:
Input: 3
Output: 4
Explanation:
           ____ 3rd step
       ____|    2nd step
   ____|        1st step
___|            Floor (0th step)

There are 4 ways the child can get from the floor to the 3rd step:
(1st step, 2nd step, 3rd step)
(1st step, 3rd step)
(2nd step, 3rd step)
(3rd step)

You will need to calculate all these possibilities and print the total number 
of different ways to get from the bottom to the top.

HINT:
You can consider the floor to be a 0th step and use it in your algorithm.
In the provided code, I have created an array of size num_steps for you. You 
can use it if you wish.

Assumptions:
--n will be >= 1
