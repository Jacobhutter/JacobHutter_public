Paging:

    Issue: Trying to set up 4MB page for Kernel.
    Solution: Had to enable 4MB pages before enabling Paging
    Fixed By: Jacob A.
    Approx. Fix Time: 1 hour

General:
    Issue: crash when integrating exception handlers with paging.
    Solution: use c-linkage initially, then switch to assembly linkage after
        noticing our asm jump table would not work as stated, essentially eip
        would trail off into no where

MP3.2 (3/14 - 3/27) (Devices)
Terminal Output:

    Solution: remove ability to destroy data written by terminal write
    Fixed By: Jacob H.
    Approx. Fix Time: 2 hours

Terminal Output:   
    Issue: Read would not wrap file in terminal. Instead, it would overwrite in
