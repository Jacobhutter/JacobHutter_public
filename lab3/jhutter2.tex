\\ Notice that this function is in the order of $-e^x$ 
therefore, it is not stable $\lim_{x_n\to\infty} y_n = -\infty$.
The system is causal, however, by the finite difference equation, output only 
depends on past or current inputs.

\\ With $a = 2$ and $x(n) = (1,0,0,....)$, or the delta function, we can see that the equation is not linear because of $x(n)^{2}$. The system is causal becasue of the fact that the finite difference equation output only depends on past or current inputs. Because the output graph is in the form of $e^x$ the equation is unnstable.
\includegraphics[scale = .5]{report3_2}
\\ With $a = 0.5$, the equation is not linear,causal,and is stable because $\lim_{x_n\to\infty} y_n = 0$.
\\ (can you find the output to either system by convolving x(n) with h(n)?)

\ We can see on the interval from $\omega$ = $0$ to $\pi$, that there is only one point where the magnitude is not zero. Therefore, there is a spike at that point.
\includegraphics[scale = .5]{report4_2}
\ We can see on the interval from $\omega = 0 to \pi $ that there is a minimum at $\omega = 0$ and a maximum at ~ $\omega = \pi/4$ so the graph is increasing until that point.
